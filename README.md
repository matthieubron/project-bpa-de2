## Software description

### State machine
![State_machine](Pictures/state_machine.svg)
*Digital clock diagram*

To reduce the number of buttons, we decide to create a state machine. We defined 4 different states. The first one is used to <b>display the current time</b>. The second one is used to set an <b>alarm</b>. The third one is used to set a <b>timer</b> and the last one is used to <b>display ambiant temperature and humidity</b>.
In the code, we use a global variable called <b>mode</b> which takes values between 0 and 3 and it is modified thanks to the function [`statemode()`](samplesOfCode/statemode.md).\
Depending on this variable
* We display informations on the current state with the function [`state()`](samplesOfCode/state.md).
* Buttons A, B and C get different purpose with the function [`configure_buttons()`](samplesOfCode/configure_buttons.md).




### Display current time
First we connect to wifi thanks to the method [`connect_wifi()`](samplesOfCode/connect_wifi.md). Then, we did an API request with [`get_time()`](samplesOfCode/get_time.md) to get current local time and save the result into variables.\
To display numbers on NeoPixels, we created a <b>dictionary</b>, connecting numbers and location of display's leds.\

<br>
We created the function [`display_time()`](samplesOfCode/display_time.md) who takes hour, minutes and the color we would like to display.\
To keep time accurate, each second, we call [`update_time()`](samplesOfCode/update_time.md).




### Alarm clock
We enter to "Alarm" mode, and to set the alarm, we created global variables: <b>alarm_h</b> and <b>alarm_m</b> which store value of the alarm time. We set this two variables thanks to buttonB and buttonC. There is also <b>alarm_on</b>, a boolean which allows to enable or disable alarm. Each seconds, we call the function [`Alarm()`](samplesOfCode/Alarm.md) which check if current time is equals to alarm time and if the alarm is enable. If it's the case, the alarm starts to ring.




### Timer
We enter to "Timer" mode and like the alarm, to set <b>minute_timer</b> and <b>second_timer</b> which are timer's variables, we click on buttonB and buttonC.
Then, to start the timer, we click on buttonA. This action will call [`toggle_timer()`](samplesOfCode/toggle_timer.md) and [`timer()`](samplesOfCode/timer.md). We can pause the timer by clicking again on buttonA.




### Temperature and humidity
In order to display temperature and humidity, we used a variable <b>display_mode</b> that control in which mode we are. When this variable is 0, the captor return the current temperature and we display it on the digital clock with the function [`display_change()`](samplesOfCode/) including the symbols Â°C. The same process happens for humidity when <b>display_mode</b> is equal to 1. You can switch between the 2 modes as you wish.




### Modules used for this project
In our project, we use several modules. Firstly, to get current time with an API request, we used `network` to connect the ESP32 to wifi, `urequests` to do the request and  `json` to access important values of the request. From the module `machine`, we import <b>Timer</b> to get current time accurate, <b>Pin</b> to use ESP32's GPIO, <b>I2C</b> to use temperature and humidity sensor and <b>PWM</b> to control the buzzer. We also use `time` module, particularly to use <b>sleep()</b> function. The module `neopixel` was used to switch on NeoPixels displays, change their color and so on. Finally, the module `_thread` was used to pause the timer.

Here is a table summing up use of buttons depending on the current state.
